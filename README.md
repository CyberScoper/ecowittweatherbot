### Installation

1. **📥 Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CyberScoper/ecowittweatherbot.git
   cd ecowittweatherbot
   ```

2. **📦 Install Required Packages**:

   Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **⚙️ Configuration**:

   - **🔑 Telegram Bot Token**:

     Obtain a bot token from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather). Replace the placeholder in the code with your bot's API token:

     ```python
     API_TOKEN = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'
     ```

   - **🔑 Weather API Keys**:

     Obtain the necessary API keys from your weather data provider. Replace the placeholders in the code with your API keys:

     ```python
     # Replace these values with your actual API keys and parameters
     application_key = 'YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY'
     api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
     mac = 'YOUR_DEVICE_MAC_ADDRESS'
     ```

     **Note**: Be sure to keep your API keys secure and do not share them publicly.

4. **💾 Set Up Data Storage**:

   Ensure that the script has write permissions to the directory where it is running, as it will create and update the following files:

   - `user_data.json`: Stores user preferences and settings.
   - `weather_data.csv`: Logs weather data periodically for training the model.

## Usage Instructions

### 🚀 Running the Bot

Run the bot script using the following command:

```bash
python bot_script.py
```

Replace `bot_script.py` with the actual name of your bot script file.

### 💬 Interacting with the Bot

Start a conversation with your bot on Telegram by searching for its username.

#### Available Commands and Features

### Data Logging and Model Training

The bot collects weather data every 5 minutes and saves it to `weather_data.csv`. The LSTM model is trained hourly using the collected data. The model and scaler parameters are saved as `lstm_model.keras`, `scaler.npy`, and `scaler_min.npy`.

## Configuration

### 🔑 API Keys and Tokens

Ensure that you have replaced the placeholder values in the script with your actual API keys and tokens.

- **🤖 Telegram Bot Token**: Replace `'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'` with your bot's token obtained from BotFather.

- **☁️ Weather API Keys**: Replace `'YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY'`, `'YOUR_API_KEY'`, and `'YOUR_DEVICE_MAC_ADDRESS'` with your weather station's API keys and MAC address.

### 📝 Logging

The bot logs its activities to the console and to a file named `training_logs.log`. You can monitor this file to see the bot's activities and any errors that may occur.
